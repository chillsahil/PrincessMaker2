The commandfile.txt file is what you use to plan out routes and send commands to the game. 

lines with '#' will be ignored, use this to make comments and separate months etc, 

the first line must be formatted as such:
Name: Game 1 (put whatever name you want here)


the commands are:
work (inputs: [Job Name], [days])
class (inputs: [Class Name], [days])
passmonth (inputs: None)
display (inputs: None)
grow (inputs: None)
vacation (inputs: [Vacation type], [days])
freetime (inputs: [days], [Paid (leave empty if unpaid)])
pocket (inputs: None)
addmoney (inputs: [Amount])


formatting commands:

each line should start with a command name(written above), 
followed by its inputs separated by a space

examples:

work Housework 7 
class Theology 7
passmonth
addmoney 100
freetime 10 Paid
grow

vacation sea 10
